# User Accounts

Your User Account can be used to access the various online services that we host.
These include the [forums](/forum), [IDE](/ide) and, for team-leaders,
a [user management interface](/userman) (see [below](#UserManagement)).

### Getting an Account
If you don't yet have an account, you should contact your team-leader,
usually your teacher, who will be able to create one for you.
They will need:

 * Your first and last names
 * Your email address &mdash; be sure to give them one you use regularly since
   we will _very_ occasionally send you important information to it
 * Which team you are in (if there is more than one team at your college)

Once your team leader has entered your details into the user management interface
you will receive an email with a link to activate your account.

Please allow at least 10 minutes for the email to be sent,
however if you've been waiting longer than this you should check with your team-leader that the account was created,
and ask them to email < {{ emails.accounts }}> if the problem remains.

### Forgotten Something?
If you forget your user name or password, you should contact your team-leader,
usually your teacher.
They will be able to tell you the details of your account, or reset your password for you.

### Password Change
If you know your password, but want to change it,
you can do this using the self service side of the [user management page](/userman).

### Other Problems
If your team-leader was unable to resolve your account issue,
you can ask them to email <{{ emails.accounts }}> for more help.

[User management for Team Leaders](#UserManagement)
====================

### Account creation

To create user accounts, visit the [user management page](/userman), and
log in. In a column on the left, you'll see a list of users currently
registered for your team.  At the bottom is a link marked 'Register users'.
Click on this, and you'll be presented with a form for user details.
Fill this in (adding rows as appropriate), click submit, and we'll begin the
account creation process.

Once you've submitted this data, you'll receive an email confirming the
registration. We'll also email the user to confirm their email
address, and to give them their usernames and passwords. If they don't
confirm their email address within two days, you'll get an email saying
that their registration expired; if this happens, you will need to
re-register them.

#### Team Leaders

When an account is created it starts off as a competitor account. In order to
allow your fellow team leaders to have full access to the user management pages
(among other things), you should change them to being a team leader account.

You can change the type of an account in the [user management page](/userman):

1. Select the user in question from the list on the left hand side
1. Under 'Type' change the selection to 'Team Leader'
1. Click 'Submit' to save the changes

Feel free to add as many team leader accounts as you like; there's no upper limit.

### Account maintenance

If you need to update any user account data, find their username,
reset their password or so forth, first log into the [user management page](/userman).

Once there, you should find the users name in the list of registered
users on the left, as well as their username. To check or update their details,
click on their name, and their registration details will appear to the right.
If you wish to edit their details, including changing their password, alter the
fields in this window and then click 'Submit'.

#### Passwords

We are unable to recover passwords once they have been set. If users
forget passwords, please find their account as described above and click the
'Send password reset' button at the bottom of the page. This will send the user
a single-use link to reset their password.

If you forget your own password, please contact <{{ emails.accounts }}>.
